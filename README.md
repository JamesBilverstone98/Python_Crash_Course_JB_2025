# Python_Crash_Course_JB_2025
This is my code for the exercises found within 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. 
I only completed the exercises for the content I found particularly interesting and content which was new to me as some exercises were not completed as I felt I had encountered similar in other Python content that I have been partaking in (such as CS50P or MOOC 2025 etc).
Python Crash Course is an incredibly insightful and beneficial book to to learn Python, especially for beginners and those without existing Python knowledge/experience (like myself).
