# CONDITIONAL TESTS = write a series of conditional tests 
# and print a statement describing each test

car = 'audi'
print("Is car == 'audi'? I predict True")
print(car == 'audi') 
# this prints as True because the statement matches the variable value

print("Is car == 'bmw'? I predict False")
print(car == 'bmw') 
# this prints as False because the current value of car is still audi

name = 'james'
print("\nJames is the best name in the world")
print(name == 'james') 
# this prints as True because the statement matches the variable value

food = 'fish'
print("\nFish is a very nice bit of food")
print(food == 'pizza') 
# this prints as False because the current value of food is still fish
