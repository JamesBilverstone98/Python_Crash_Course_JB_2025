# TWO D8S = Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two 
# eight-sided dice 1,000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization
# will look like before you run the simulation, then see if your intuition was 
# correct. Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the 
# limits of your systemâ€™s capabilities.
